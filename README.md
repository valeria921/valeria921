## Hi, I’m Valeria 👩‍💻✨
I'm diving into the tech world with curiosity, creativity, and the kind of stubbornness that makes me build full-stack apps.

Right now, I'm looking for a junior developer role where I can grow, learn from a team, and also bring my ideas to life.

My main focus is backend development with Python, Django, and Django REST Framework.
But I also build full-stack projects from scratch additionally using React.js, Tailwind, HTML, CSS.
Git, and Docker are part of my daily toolbox too.

### 🚀 What I’ve built so far:

- **[SnapFact](https://idonotlikedocker.com)** – a quirky full-stack app + Telegram bot that delivers random facts.
Yes, it's live on a server. Yes, I named the domain "idonotlikedocker.com" on purpose as a little memory of deployment struggles 😄
(Spoiler: I do use Docker now and plan to keep using it.)
- Currently building a **car wash management system** – a full-stack app that helps manage everything inside a real car wash: orders, salaries, reports, and more.
I’m deep in Django, DRF, and React.js, and I’m loving this challenge.

### 🧠 Currently learning more about:

Every new feature I build teaches me something. I'm especially focused now on:
- Advanced Django & DRF patterns
- Clean code & better architecture

### ✨ About me:

Creative by nature, problem-solver by instinct.  
I don’t overthink “Can I do this?” — I just start, figure things out, and finish.
That mindset helps me say “YES” to bold ideas (like the car washing project) and actually make them real.
Challenges? I kind of enjoy them 😁
